we have built a comprehensive pipeline that can be run any time matter of fact can be customized on any website with small tweeks
1. scraping (when run it will get the new data if it's updated)
2. preprocessing (a simple but powerfull, that resulted in less than 1Mb TF-IDF model and matrix for retrival)
    - [ ] TODO: can be enhanced later by using a morphological analyser for lemmatization (can be achived using Camel-tools)
3. mix between rule-based and corpse/retrival based chatbots for better covarotion and human interaction
4. a simple API integation for the UI
5. A CLI tool to handle all of this like running the pipline or running the server
